v 1.0.5
	Bug Fixes:
	- Visualization will now properly show for an entity selected in the hierarchy before pressing play in the editor.
	- Visualization for AIs with multiple paths to an AI link will now work as expected.
	- A number of additional fixes to visualization mainly to do with run time loading and enabling/disabling of AIs.

v 1.0.4
	Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed a bug where auto generation of Context and Context Provider from the Utility AI Component would generate incorrect c#.
	- Fixed a bug with List fields in the inspector.
	- Fixed a few bugs related to replacing certain action types with others.

	Improvements:
	- Dictionary fields are now supported in the inspector.
	- New composite qualifiers, 'All above threshold' and 'Minimum or Nothing'
	- The Repair utility will now offer options for enum fields/properties
	- Instead of using a random existing Resources folder for storing AIs, the root Resources folder is used or created if it does not exist.

v 1.0.3
	Bug Fixes:
	- Disabling an AI in the Utility AI Component for non-prefab entities was not properly persisted.
